## Inspiration
The challenges of Automation Anywhere which were happened in last 4 weeks maybe these challenges inspired me a lot.

## What it does
This project is about download the CSV file and extract data from CSV files and enter each missing customer's information and click 'Register' after entering each customer's details on website

## How we built it
I have built this bot using various actions named Browser:Open ,  Capture , CSV/TXT: Open ,Read and close.
I have used loop here to fill same form of data one by one .
Then I have used 7-8 Capture Actions for getting customer's information. If and else conditions are also there for "yes or no" radio button .
At last Capture action is used for Register .

## Challenges we ran into
 I faced the challenge here that When I was running the bot It was taking only some data and some not. So I have decided to debug it and see  from where the problem was coming. So when I debug it , I got the problem, the problem was it was only some data and directly clicking on Register . then afterwards I solved it .

## What we learned
I have learned here loop , If and else conditions  . How to use it , what conditions we were supposed to give and how according to requirement .
